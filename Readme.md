Java WebServer
==============

This is a webserver I created in Java (it doesn't implement the complete spec, only the basics and the features I needed). It also has a simple interface intended to make it easy to use. The interface is styled after [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) as much as you can get with Java.

To see what it looks like in practice, check out how I use it to [serve Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/JoshCheek/java-ttt-web-interface/blob/master/src/com/joshcheek/ttt/web/TTTServer.java#L34-72).

I created it as a practice assignment during my residency at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/). I'm pretty happy with it, it's the first time I've done any real work with threads or sockets.
